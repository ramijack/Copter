# Copter

Creating a UI for controlling propeller angular velocity from keyboard keys.
this project is unstable, and lot of errors are still there.
This Project uses RPIO library, and the coding is being done in python.

The "Motor.py" file i got it from some blogs(i dont remember exactly.) while trying to fly quadcopter.
